## **Introduction**  
Wildlife populations worldwide face increasing threats due to climate change, habitat destruction, and poaching. This project is designed to help conservationists and researchers predict a species' conservation score based on biological features, assisting in prioritizing efforts to protect wildlife.  

The project integrates:  
1. **Machine Learning**: A linear regression model trained on biological features of animal species.  
2. **REST API**: A robust FastAPI backend hosted on Render, exposing prediction endpoints.  
3. **Mobile App**: A Flutter-based application providing an interactive user interface for making predictions.

## **Features**  
### **Core Functionalities**  
- **Dynamic Predictions**: Predict conservation scores based on biological features like Hair, Feathers, Backbone, etc.  
- **Interactive Mobile App**: User-friendly app with dropdowns, text fields, and an image carousel.  
- **Public API**: Accessible endpoints for predictions, compatible with Swagger UI for testing.  

### **Additional Features**  
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile app adapts to various screen sizes.  
- **Error Handling**: Robust validation in both the API and mobile app for better user experience.  
- **Scalability**: Backend hosted on Render for global accessibility.  

---

## **Technologies Used**  
### **Backend**  
- **FastAPI**: To create the REST API for predictions.  
- **Joblib**: For loading the trained linear regression model.  
- **Pandas**: For handling input data transformation.  
- **Render**: Hosting the API for public access.  

### **Mobile App**  
- **Flutter**: For cross-platform mobile application development.  
- **Dart**: Language used for Flutter development.  
- **FontAwesome Icons**: For enhanced UI elements.  

### **Machine Learning**  
- **Algorithm**: Linear Regression, chosen for its interpretability and suitability for numeric predictions.  
- **Features**: Focused on biological traits of animals such as Hair, Feathers, and Backbone.

## **Dataset Information**  
The dataset used for model training was sourced from the **[Kaggle Zoo Animal Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/krishnabhatt4/zoo-animal-classification/input?select=zoo.csv)**.  

### **Key Features**  
1. **Hair**: Presence of hair (1 = Yes, 0 = No).  
2. **Feathers**: Presence of feathers (1 = Yes, 0 = No).  
3. **Backbone**: Presence of a backbone (1 = Yes, 0 = No).  
4. **Fins**: Presence of fins (1 = Yes, 0 = No).  
5. **Class_Type**: Type of class (e.g., Mammal, Bird, etc.).  
6. **Animal Names**: Specific species such as Clam, Slug, Worm, etc.  

**Note**: Features were preprocessed to create dummy variables for categorical inputs (e.g., Animal_Name_clam).

## **Public API Endpoint**  
The backend API is publicly hosted on Render, making it accessible worldwide for predictions.
